# stepper-motor-control
Based on c51.  

A CNC system for three-coordinate linked stepper motor.  

In terms of controlling three-coordinate linked stepper motor,you can manually finish not only the positive and negative turn,stop,speed switch of the three stepper motor,but also a single step to perform fast positioning,linear interpolation,circular interpolation,reverse circular interpolation of the numerical control instructions,and you can also put these instructions into the automatic program,which can make a specific pattern as you like.  

The control input signal can be a physical button or a VB program on the computer.  

The output signal is the direction and speed of the stepper motors.
